# MobArena Refabricated

## About

An attempt at partly recreating the Spigot plugin MobArena in Fabric. The main purpose of this mod is to (at some point) have an arena where you can fight monsters, similar to but not necessarily exactly like MobArena. 
It is currently not in a playable state as most features haven't been implemented yet.
