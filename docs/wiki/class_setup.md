Classes are important for gameplay variety in this mod. You can use almost any weapon, armour or item that you want, including ones from other mods. If you want to have a gunner class, you can!

To set up a class, you equip the items you want to use and then run the command below:
* /ma set class *name*

where name is your desired class name such as warrior or archer. 

Make sure that you put the items in the slots in the inventory that you want the items to appear in, such as a sword in the first slot, and a shield in the shield slot.

**NOTE: The Trinkets mod is not supported yet!**
## Using the classes
To allow players to use classes you will need to set up signs in the lobby using this format:

LINE 1: [arena]

LINE 2: *name*

Now you should be able to select a class by right clicking any of the class signs in the lobby before entering the arena.

**NOTE: Class names are case sensitive! *"Archer"* is not the same as *"archer"*.**
